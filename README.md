# ðŸ“– About the README

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didnâ€™t find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that itâ€™ll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Hereâ€™s why:

. Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others

. You shouldnâ€™t be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch

. You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ðŸ˜„

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So Iâ€™ll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people who have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the BLANK_README.md to get started.

## Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

. NETX.JS

. REACT

. VUE.JS

. ANGULAR

. SVELTE

. LARAVEL

. BOOTSTRAP

. JQUERY

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

. npm

    npm install npm@latest -g

## Installation

Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesnâ€™t rely on any external dependencies or services.

1.  Get a free API key at https://example.com

2.  Clone the repo

        git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git

3.  Install NPM packages

        npm install

4.  Enter your API in config.js

        const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';

5.  Change git remote URL to avoid accidental pushes to base project

        git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
        git remote -v # confirm the changes

## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and dernos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.
